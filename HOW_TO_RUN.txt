python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('wordnet')"

STEP 5: Run the Flask Application
-------------------------------
Type this command and press Enter:
python app.py

You should see output like:
- Loading models...
- Heart disease model loaded
- Heart scaler loaded
- Heart feature columns loaded
- Symptom model and vectorizer loaded
- X-ray model loaded
- All models loaded successfully!
- Starting Flask application...
- Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

STEP 6: Open Web Browser
-----------------------
- Open any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

1. Enter symptoms in the text box (e.g., "chest pain and shortness of breath")
2. Fill in heart disease parameters (optional)
3. Upload a chest X-ray image (optional)
4. Click "Get AI Prediction"
5. View the results with probability scores

TROUBLESHOOTING
==============

Problem: "No module named flask"
Solution: Run Step 3 to install Flask
